This file exists to help me remember what JSON data needs to be POSTed to each URL, or what JSON data will be returned.
Mainly for UI development purposes, but I left this here for reference.


A response for a user's post:
{
	"id": 1234,
	"user": 5678,
	"points": 5,
	"message": "this is my post, in which I am well pleased."
	"comments": [
		
	]
}


Create a post request:
{
	"message": "wow I expected this to be more complicated, but the user's ID info is in the header so this is all we need."
}


Create new user request:
{
  "firstName": "Bobby",
  "lastName": "Appleseed",
  "email": "test@test.com",
  "password": "password"
}


Headers for logging in:
email: useremail@example.com
password: passwordhere

Headers for using the site post-login:
hash: <password hash here>
